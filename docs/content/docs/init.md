Initialize writ configuration in a git repository: resolve or mint a writer ID, verify SSH signing key configuration, and add fetch refspecs for git remotes.

## Synopsis

```
writ init [remote...]
```

## What it does

`writ init` prepares a repository for writ operations. It writes fetch refspecs into `.git/config` so that `git fetch` carries writ data into remote-tracking refs.
